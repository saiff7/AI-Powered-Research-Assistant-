# AI-Powered-Research-Assistant-

This Python script uses Googleâ€™s Gemini AI model to create a chat-based assistant capable of performing specific tasks:

Research Paper Retrieval: It fetches research papers from arXiv based on a given topic using the find_papers() function.

Bar Chart Generation: The assistant creates and saves bar charts using Matplotlib, generated from user-provided data through the create_bar_chart() function.

Interactive Chat: Users can interact with the assistant, ask for papers or charts, and get responses. It also handles commands like "new" to start a new chat and "end" to exit.

Logging & Function Calls: The assistant includes logging for debugging and function calling to handle tasks like retrieving papers or creating charts.

Overall, it demonstrates the integration of AI, data visualization, and research paper retrieval in a user-friendly assistant.
